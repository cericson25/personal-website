        <p>
          I start this project on 6/29/2022; the summer before my sophomore year
          of Highschool after starting The Odin Project, Harvard's CS50 course,
          and finishing the iDTech MIT Javascript Course. My knowledge of HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript are all limited; but using the resources above, I
          am excited to see what I can do and where coding can take me.

        <p>
          Today I finished the first draft of my personal website. It uses
          flexbox instead of coordinate positions to align elements, even when
          the page shrinks. I also completed the landing page project on TOP,
          which taught me flexbox as I know it now.

        <h3>Background Info</h3>
        <p>
          It's been awhile since I've coded anything for TOP, so I tried to
          progress as much as I can. I finished the Rock Paper Scissors lesson,
          which teaches basic JavaScript. I had a lot of fun writing and
          debugging the code for it, but I want to make a user interface next. I
          also want to start another personal passion project, but my options
          are still limited by my skills, so I'll have to stay committed to
          improving.

        <p>
          Today I finished the Rock Paper Scissors game project. I am extremely
          happy with how the ui turned out, however I would like to add a play
          again button. I also gained the knowledge of how to use GitHub
          branches, which seem incredible useful to work on new features and
          additions.
