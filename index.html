            This is a personal website project designed by me, Connor Ericson.
            The reason for designing this website is to serve as a portfolio,
            timeline, and motivation for my coding endeavors, all in one
            organized place.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're interested in the work I have done or want an updated log
            on what skills I have learned, click on the Portfolio and Skills
            DevLog tabs at the top of the screen. If you'd also like to know
            more about me and my life outside of coding, you can find more
            information further down this page.

            <p>
              I'm currently going into my Sophomore year of highschool, trying
              to learn and improve my coding ability using Online Resources such
              as
              <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and
              <a
                href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0"
                >CS 50</a
              >. I have also completed an MIT JavaScript coding course, fueling
              my eagerness to learn more about Web Development.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of Coding, I enjoy playing Videogames, Volleyball, and
              Soccer. Sports have always had a big impact on me, and without
              them I wouldn't be the same person I am today.
            </p>

            <p>
              I hope to make progress and stay motivated towards further
              improvement in all areas, but I don't yet know what goals I want
              to accomplish and what career paths I will pursue.
