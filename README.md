# personal-website

This is a personal website project, the purpose of which is as a log for looking back and seeing how I've improved and grown as a developer.

I start this project on 6/29/2022; the summer before my sophomore year of Highschool after starting The Odin Project, Harvard's CS50 course, and finishing the iDTech MIT Javascript Course. I hope to make progress and stay motivated towards further improvement, but I don't yet know what goals I want to accomplish and what career paths I will pursue.
